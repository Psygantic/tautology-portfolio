title: How we treat each other
---

<p>A tautology is a formula that is true in every possible interpretation. First and foremost, we are true to ourselves and to each other.</p>

<p>We abide by all federal, state, and local laws when in non-private areas of our events and camps, and are each responsible for our guests. We clean up after ourselves regularly and Leave No Trace of our events and camps when we're done. We are present, awake, and sober when our collective is counting on us to be. We identify and communicate about our needs early and often. We proactively take care of our own needs for food, water, and rest.</p>

<p>We listen non-judgmentally to ourselves and to everyone else with an open heart. We speak only out of and about our personal experiences and understandings. When faced with a choice between being curious and being defensive, we choose to be curious. We treat people how they would like to be treated. And if we don’t know how, we ask.</p>

<p>We respect each others’ personal space and possessions, and check in before touching someone or their belongings. We use common spaces for the common good, and keep activities out of common spaces that render them unusable for that purpose. We respect each others’ consent and boundaries. Consent is voluntary, sober, enthusiastic, verbal, non-coerced, continual, active, and honest. Yes means yes, no means no, maybe means no, and silence is not consent. We accept no without arguing, and say yes when we mean yes!</p>

<p>We make mistakes. Everything that happens in this collective is part of a learning experience. We act from an assumption of mutual respect and good will. We clarify misunderstandings and apologize for harm caused. We choose to forgive and assume ignorance rather than malice. We communicate with chosen names, pronouns, and genders. We watch out for each other to maintain a happy and safe collective, treating each other with peace, love, unity, and respect.</p>

<p>And if we don’t know how, we ask.</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 12pt;">How we negotiate authority</h4>

<p>We are a collective of people who make art. That art might be an installation, a musical performance, a film, an interactive event, or something else entirely.  We also camp together and host events from time to time. Anyone in the collective is welcome to propose to lead or co-lead an art project, camp, or event, and anyone is welcome to ask to join in!</p>

<p>The collective itself isn't necessarily involved in the administration of any art project, camp, or event put together by its members. Although dues or fees may be required to join a camp or attend an event of ours, there are no dues or fees required to be a part of the collective itself. When hosting an event, art project, or camp under the Tautology name, we ask that at least one of the leads be someone who has the ability to manage the mailing list.</p>

<p>There are a few people who manage our mailing list. They're ultimately responsible for who's able to join and who may be asked to leave the collective. If you need to be able to regularly add people to the collective, such as to support a funded art project, contact <a href="mailto:tautology+owners@googlegroups.com">tautology+owners@googlegroups.com</a> to request being added to the group that manages the mailing list. Those who manage the mailing list aren't responsible for mediating conflicts between its members, but may opt to do so off-list if it's requested of them and consented to by those who are in conflict.</p>

<p>There are also a few people who manage our website, at <a href="http://tautology.io/">tautology.io</a> and our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tautology-Arts-Collective/630455687055582?fref=ts">facebook page</a>. They're ultimately responsible for the content we publish. If you have a piece of art, an event, or camp that you'd like showcased there, again, email <a href="mailto:tautology+owners@googlegroups.com">tautology+owners@googlegroups.com</a> with photos and descriptions so we can help you to get publicity for your work.</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 12pt;">Adding and removing members of the collective</h4>

<p>Our mailing list is our primary way of communicating together. Our baseline expectation is radically inclusive: anyone who is interested is joining is welcome on the mailing list, at our events, and in our camps. Contact <a href="mailto:tautology+owners@googlegroups.com">tautology+owners@googlegroups.com</a> to offer an introduction and request an invitation.</p>

<p>To preserve the safety and autonomy of our collective and its members, anyone who assaults or harasses a member of Tautology is not welcome in our camps, at our events, or on the collective's mailing list. Further, anyone employed as a federal, state, or local law enforcement officer is not welcome on our mailing list.</p>

<p>If you believe someone needs to be removed from camp or an event, contact the person who organized that camp or event. If you believe someone needs to be removed from the mailing list, contact <a href="mailto:tautology+owners@googlegroups.com">tautology+owners@googlegroups.com</a>. If that individual is removed, the person removing them will notify the collective of that decision through an email to the mailing list.</p>
