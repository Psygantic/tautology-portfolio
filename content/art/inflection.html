<p>Inflection is a 2015 Burning Man honorarium art installation led by <a href="http://spacemeat.net/">Trevor Schrock</a>&mdash;a large rope bridge rising and twisting out of the desert. Tautology is helping build and support this art project at <a href="http://burningman.org/">Burning Man 2015</a> and at <a href="http://www.criticalnw.org/">Critical Northwest 2015</a>.</p>

<p>A light garden consisting of works by other Cascadian artists will surround the bridge. The vision, philosophy, description, and more renders are available on <a href="http://spacemeat.net/inflection/">Inflection's site</a>.</p>
